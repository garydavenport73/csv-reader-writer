Overall notes...

If a cell is read in by csv destined for array element:
1) if it contains outer quotes, remove them
2) then replace interior double quotes "" with "
So process is to:
    -split by "real commas"
    -remove outer quotes if present
    -replace interior "" with "

If array element is being written to csv
    replace interior "" with "
    place outer quotes
    join with comma
